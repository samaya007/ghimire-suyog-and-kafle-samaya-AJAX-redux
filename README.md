# AJAX Redux

This is a group project by Ghimire Suyog and Kafle Samaya, where we have used Starwars API to dynamically load and display information about Starwars characters and movies. We have also used gsap animation to make it visually appealing and have used grids to make it responsive. We have used a custom Star Wars font and dynamically added images through js. This Starwars themed website has an interactive way for users to learn more about Star Wars characters and the franchise.

## Objective
This website was created to understand the implementation of API to populate a website at the same time making it responsive and interactive with animation and effects. This website also helps users learn about the Star Wars franchise.
